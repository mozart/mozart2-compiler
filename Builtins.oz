%% This defines a function `GetBuiltinInfo' that returns information
%% about the builtin with a given name A.  This information is either:
%%
%%    noBuiltin
%%       if A does not denote a known builtin.
%%
%%    builtin(types: [procedure] det: [procedure]...)
%%       if A denotes a known builtin with argument types as given.
%%       The following features may or may not be contained in the
%%       record, as appropriate:
%%
%%          inlineFun: B
%%             if this feature is present and B is true, than A may
%%             be called using one the `inlineFun...' instructions.
%%             This feature cannot be present at the same time as
%%             an inlineRel feature.
%%          eqeq: B
%%             if this feature is present and B is true, then A must
%%             be called using the `inlineEqEq' instruction.
%%             The inlineFun feature must be present and true.
%%          inlineRel: B
%%             if this feature is present and B is true, than A may
%%             be called using one the `inlineRel...' instructions.
%%             This feature cannot be present at the same time as
%%             an inlineFun feature.
%%          rel: A2
%%             if this feature is present, then A2 is the name of
%%             another builtin that may be used in a shallowTest
%%             instruction instead of this builtin.
%%          doesNotReturn: B
%%             if this feature is present and B is true, then any
%%             statement following the call to A is not executed.
%%          destroysArguments: B
%%             if this feature is present and B is true, then after
%%             the builtin application the contents of the argument
%%             registers is not guaranteed.
%%
%% This function really should be a builtin itself so that it becomes
%% easier to keep this information up-to-date when the emulator is
%% modified.
